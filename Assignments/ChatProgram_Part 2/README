Assignment 1: Chat Program Part 2

Name: Jacob Wong & Jicheng Zhao


Accessories:
- Arduino Mega Board (AMG)
- USB cable, A-B style
- 560 Ohm Resistor (Green Blue Brown)

Used code for rolling cipher and state machine as well as
guideline on how to format state machine based on diagram

Worksheet for Modular Multiplication as guide for mulMod function

Wiring Instructions:
- Arduino A TX3 pin <--> Arduino B RX3 pin
- Arduino B TX3 pin <--> Arduino A RX3 pin
- Arduino A GND pin <--> Arduino B GND pin
- Arduino A digital pin 13 <--> Resistor <--> Arduino B 5V pin

How to run the Code:
- Make sure both Arduinos are plugged into the computer
- Make upload to both Arduinos (make upload-0 & make upload-1)
- Open two terminals and run serial-mon-0 & 1 on the two terminals

Assumptions:
- Modified code from Assignment 1 Part 1
- Sometimes the client or server terminal would "connect" when opening their
  serial monitor even though the other serial monitor was not open yet.
	We assumed to fix this problem was to close both serial monitors
	and reopen both and the problem should be solved.
- User knows what Diffie Hellman process, Rolling cipher and State machines are


Description:
This program can be used between two users that want to communicate through
their personally customized Arduino devices. The program will also encrypt and
decrypt their messages (character by character) to ensure the privacy of their
conversation (Using the Diffie Hellman process). This program is also an improvement
on the previous chat program in that the exchange of the user's keys are done
automatically and uses an more complicated encryption process.
