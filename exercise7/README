Used and modified code from compiling_steps from Zac's Google drive (Lec 19- Nov 7)
Reference to the Euclid Algorithm on the Exercise 7 description

Wiring Instructions:
- None

Assumptions:
- User will enter non-negative numbers
- At least one of the numbers entered will be positive (i.e. # > 0)
- Numbers entered will be less than 2^32 - 1

How to run the Code:
- type "make clean" in the terminal to remove any .o files that may be in directory
- type "make exercise7" in the terminal
- type "./exercise7" in the terminal and enter the 2 numbers

Description:
The purpose of this program is to find the greatest common divisor for two numbers
entered by the user. The greatest common divisor is the largest number that both numbers
can be divided by. In order to implement this, the Euclid's algorithm which uses
recursion to calculate this number. As well, included is a Makefile that was created
for this program that would compile and link to separate C++ files as well as
remove the .o files when the user runs a certain command.
