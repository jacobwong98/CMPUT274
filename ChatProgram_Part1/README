Assignment 1 Part 1: Chat Program

Names: Jacob Wong and Jicheng Zhao


Accessories:
- 2 x Arduino Mega Board (AMG)
- 2 x USB cables, A-B style

Wiring Instructions:
- Arduino A TX3 pin <--> Arduino B RX3 pin
- Arduino B TX3 pin <--> Arduino A RX3 pin
- Arduino A GND pin <--> Arduino B GND pin

How to run the Code:
- Make sure both Arduinos are plugged into the computer
- Make upload to both Arduinos (make upload-0 & make upload-1)
- Open two terminals and run serial-mon-0 & 1 on the two terminals

References:
Used and modified code from Zac's google drive (read_t, diffie_hellman, encrypt_decrypt)

Assumptions:
- User must press enter once they have typed the other user's public key
- Even though we use 16 bit integers, we used 32 bit integer types to account
	for overflow
- Assume that the user will not start chatting until the "You are connected" message
	prints on both screens
- Assume the user knows what the Diffie Hellman process is or can Google it

Description:
This program can be used between two users that want to communicate through
their personally customized Arduino devices. The program will also encrypt and
decrypt their messages (character by character) to ensure the privacy of their
conversation (Using the Diffie Hellman process).
