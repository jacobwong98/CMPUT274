Exercise 5: Display and Joystick

Name: Jacob Wong
CCID: jdw2
Student ID: 1511712

Accessories:
- Arduino Mega Board (AMG)
- USB cable, A-B style
- Adafruit ILI9341 breakout board
- SainSmart JoyStick Module

References:
Used and modified code from joy_cursor from Zac's Google drive (Lec 13- Oct 17)

Assumptions:
- When moving the cursor to the right side of the screen where the black bar was,
	the cursor would "remove" one pixel on the black bar with a portion of the map.
	So to account for this I changed the constrain on the max x-value to be 49 bits
	to make sure that the cursor did not remove any of the black bar.

Instructions to wiring the Adafruit_ILI9341 screen. To wire the joystick, follow
the given instructions from in-class discussion as well as described on eclass Exercise 5

How to run the Code:
Load the program into the Arduino and look at the display screen for the Adafruit_ILI9341

Description:
The purpose of this program is to improve upon the joy_cursor code that was created
in class. The improvements that were made will ensure that the cursor will not
leave behind a black trail but rather to show no trail. As well, the code will
restrain the cursor from going past the edges of the display screen and the black
bar that we intentionally put on the map. Then, the cursor should vary it's speed
depending on the amount that the cursor is moved. Finally, the cursor would blink
when sitting still and this occurrence was taken care of.
