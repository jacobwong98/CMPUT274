Accessories:
- Arduino Mega Board (AMG)
- USB cable, A-B style

References:
Used and modified code from diffie_hellman from Zac's Google drive

How to run the Code:
Load the program into the Arduino and open a serial monitor

Description:
The purpose of this program is to take a string and get the length of
the string as well as print the given string backwards to the serial monitor.
We also wanted to test to see that the two functions we created would
produced the correct results. The functions can be found in the
string_processing C++ file.
