CCID: jdw2
Student ID: 1511712

Accessories:

References:
Used and modified code from rest_sd from Zac's Google drive (Lec 14- Oct 19)

Wiring Instructions:
- Arduino <--> Computer/Laptop

How to run the Code:
Load the program into the Arduino and open the serial monitor.

Description:
The purpose of this program is to improve upon the rest_sd code that was given to
us in class. The improvements that we wanted to make was that the getRestaurant
function in the code would call a block every iteration. However, because
accessing the SD card is slow we needed to fix this. So to account for this,
the getRestaurantFast was made so that the SD card is only accessed
when the restaurant that is called is not within the restaurant block (8 restaurants in a block).
